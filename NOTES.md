>
>Exclude 
>- BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations

>- high-risk lesion on previous biopsies
>
>AKA "a genetic marker or syndrome associated with a high risk of breast cancer (e.g., BRCA1 or BRCA2 genetic mutations), a history of high-dose radiation therapy to the chest at a young age, or previous breast cancer or a high-risk breast lesion on previous biopsies."

FYI here is the code for BRCA:
```
 2024 ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code Z15.01
Genetic susceptibility to malignant neoplasm of breast

    2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Billable/Specific Code POA Exempt 

    Z15.01 is a billable/specific ICD-10-CM code that can be used to indicate a diagnosis for reimbursement purposes.
    The 2024 edition of ICD-10-CM Z15.01 became effective on October 1, 2023.
    This is the American ICD-10-CM version of Z15.01 - other international versions of ICD-10 Z15.01 may differ.
